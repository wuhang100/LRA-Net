For visitors to this repo,


Thank you for your interest to this work.

This is a moderate refinement to our previous work accepted by ICPR2020. The main change is the fine decoder, which makes it achieve better performance on 8 categories of objects.

Although I have uploaded the main codes of this paper to this repository, I recommond you to refer to [this repository](https://github.com/HangWu2020/CRA-Net) in the future, our ICPR codes have been uploaded there, and more importantly, we make further improvements of our network and more discussions on its properties in a extended paper submitted to a journal, it's now under review, and I will upload this final version there.


Best,

Hang Wu
